# friendPosts

Hi, I'm Kevin Alexander Quispe RomÃ¡n. By the way, I have built this web application. 

FriendPosts is a Post web app where you can share some pictures of trips or anything related to experiences.
This app use some firebase services such as authentication, cloud firestore and storage. Mainly, its functionality is 
understandable.
You can register on the web app by a modal form and to make sure your email address is not fake and  is  available, you must confirm your account by clicking on a 
confirmation link as well as log in using your credentials.
Then, you can see the posts that your friends have posted, yours as well.
Also can create a new post by clicking on a modal form and choosing a photo or picture.
At the end, it will be listed with the rest of posts you had created before.


This app has many features to reorganise and upgrade, so I will do it later.
Send me a message if you wanna contact me =========> qalexander370@gmail.com.
